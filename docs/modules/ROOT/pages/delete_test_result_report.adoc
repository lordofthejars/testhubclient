= Delete Test Result Report
:source-highlighter: highlightjs

You can delete any test result that has been previously published by using `delete` command.

== Example

Let's see a minimal example on how to use Test Hub Client to delete the result of a build.

[source, bash]
----
testhubclient delete \ // <1>
              --project myproject \ // <2>
              --build 1 // <3>
----
<1> `delete` command to delete test artifacts
<2> `project` flag to set project that contains the test results
<3> `build` flag to set which build identifier that contains the test results

So running previous command will connect to a Test Hub running at `http://localhost:8000`.

== Command

The command to indicate that you want to delete test artifacts is `delete`.

This operation supports next flags:
