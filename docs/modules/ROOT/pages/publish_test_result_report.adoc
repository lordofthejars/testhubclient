= Publish Test Result Report
:source-highlighter: highlightjs

One of the main tasks of Test Hub Client is to publish the report generated by test execution to Test Hub.
This process implies next process in Test Hub Client:

. Detect the type of project (currently only `Maven + Surefire` is supported).
. Package all test reports into a `.tar.gz` file.
. Get automatic values in case of not specified manually.
. Send request to Test Hub.

From the point of view of Test Hub implies next things, when it receives the request:

. Register a new build.
. Uncompress provided test artifacts.
. Calculate test results and update trend.

== Example

Let's see a minimal example on how to use Test Hub Client to publish the result of a build.

[source, bash]
----
testhubclient push \ // <1>
              --project myproject \ // <2>
              --build 1 // <3>
----
<1> `push` command to upload test artifacts
<2> `project` flag to set project that contains the test results
<3> `build` flag to set which build identifier has generated the test results

So running previous command will connect to a Test Hub running at `http://localhost:8000` set `commit` flag with current commit id and `branch` flag with current branch.

== Command

The command to indicate that you want to publish some test artifacts is `push`.

This operation supports next flags:
